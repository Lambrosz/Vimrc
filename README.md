Other settings: 
- On MacBook, I mapped 'Caps Lock' + [h,j,k,l] to work like arrow keys for Vim-like navigation everywhere.
- On MacBook, added a setting in tmux.conf to enable colors to show correctly when Vim runs in tmux.

TODO:
- Create bash script to install these files on the current system.
- Add tmux.conf to the repo.
